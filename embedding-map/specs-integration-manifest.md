# Specs Module Integration Manifest

## Executive Summary

The `specs/verification` and `specs/correction` modules form the **quality enforcement backbone** of stdLibSchema, providing executable specifications that ensure code consistency, architectural adherence, and automated remediation across the entire codebase.

## Core Role in stdLibSchema Traceability Web

### 1. **Foundational Quality Layer**
The specs modules serve as the foundational layer for enforcing code quality and architectural consistency:

- **Verification Module**: Acts as the gatekeeper, validating all code against defined standards
- **Correction Module**: Provides automated remediation, reducing manual intervention
- **Core Engine**: Orchestrates rule execution with sophisticated caching and performance optimization

### 2. **Architectural Enforcement**

#### Upstream Dependencies
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Provides the architectural principles that verification rules enforce
- **RULEBOOK.json**: Defines module boundaries and dependency rules validated by specs
- **stdlib**: Supplies core utilities for file operations, logging, and error handling

#### Downstream Consumers
- **schematics/verify**: Command-line interface for running verification rules
- **schematics/correct**: Command-line interface for applying corrections
- **hub-core**: Uses specs for multi-agent workflow validation
- **DuckPlane_exe**: Integrates specs into task orchestration and validation pipelines

### 3. **Cross-Project Integration**

#### With DuckPlane_exe
- **Validation Workflows**: Specs rules are invoked during DuckPlane task execution
- **BLC-001 Protocol**: SpecGenerator creates rules from DuckPlane specifications
- **Quality Gates**: Pre-commit and CI/CD validation using specs rules

#### With Warp Terminal
- **Commands**: `ng g @stdlibschema/schematics:verify` and `correct`
- **Configuration**: `.warp/launch.json` defines specs execution parameters
- **Agent Integration**: Warp agent understands specs violations and can suggest corrections

### 4. **Rule Ecosystem**

#### Verification Rules (18 total)
- **Code Quality** (6 rules): Naming, complexity, file size, imports, console usage
- **Performance** (3 rules): Bundle optimization, circular dependencies, lazy loading
- **Security** (2 rules): Secret detection, dependency vulnerabilities
- **Architecture** (4 rules): Module boundaries, dependency flow
- **Hub-Core Specific** (4 rules): Messaging patterns, resource usage

#### Correction Rules (5+ implemented)
- **Auto-fixable violations**: Component naming, console statements, imports, complexity, file size
- **Plugin-based**: Z85 encoding corrections from external plugins
- **Strategy-based**: Multiple correction strategies per rule type

### 5. **Execution Framework**

#### Core Components
```
RuleRegistry â†’ RuleExecutor â†’ Reporter
     â†“              â†“            â†“
ConfigLoader â†’ ResultCache â†’ Performance Metrics
```

#### Key Features
- **Parallel Execution**: Rules run concurrently for performance
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time feedback during long operations
- **Performance Metrics**: Memory, CPU, and wall time tracking
- **Caching**: Results cached to avoid redundant verification
- **Plugin System**: Extensible with custom rules via isolated-vm

### 6. **Quality Assurance Integration**

#### With Duck-Doctor Agent
- Specs rules feed into duck-doctor validation workflows
- Automatic correction suggestions based on violation patterns
- Integration with rumination layer for continuous improvement

#### Test Coverage
- Most rules have 85%+ test coverage
- Comprehensive test suites for each rule
- Performance benchmarks for rule execution

### 7. **Configuration Management**

#### Presets
- **strict**: Maximum enforcement for production code
- **recommended**: Balanced rules for general development
- **minimal**: Basic rules for prototyping
- **performance**: Focus on performance-related rules
- **security**: Emphasis on security validations

#### Configuration Sources
1. `.stdlibschema-specs.json` (project-specific)
2. `package.json` (specs configuration section)
3. Inline configuration (runtime options)
4. Preset templates (built-in configurations)

## Implementation Status

### Completed âœ…
- Core verification rules (18 implemented)
- Core correction rules (5 implemented)
- Rule registry and executor
- Configuration management
- Reporter system (console, HTML, JSON, markdown)
- Plugin architecture
- Performance tracking

### In Progress ðŸ”„
- TypeScript build error fixes in correction rules
- Test timeout resolution
- Coverage restoration (currently ~61%, target 67%+)

### Planned ðŸ“‹
- Additional architecture rules
- Context7 MCP integration for library-specific rules
- Enhanced plugin sandboxing
- Real-time violation monitoring

## Critical Integration Points

1. **Entry Points**
   - `schematics/verify/index.ts`: CLI entry for verification
   - `schematics/correct/index.ts`: CLI entry for correction
   - `specs/core/registry.ts`: Programmatic rule access

2. **Configuration Files**
   - `.stdlibschema-specs.json`: Project configuration
   - `RULEBOOK.json`: Dependency rules
   - `.warp/launch.json`: Warp integration

3. **Message Contracts**
   - `RuleExecutionRequest`: Trigger rule execution
   - `ViolationReport`: Report violations
   - `CorrectionApplied`: Notify corrections

4. **Data Flows**
   ```
   Source Code â†’ Verification â†’ Violations â†’ Correction â†’ Fixed Code
        â†“           â†“             â†“            â†“           â†“
   AST Parser â†’ Rules Engine â†’ Reporter â†’ Fix Engine â†’ File Writer
   ```

## Usage in Development Workflow

1. **Pre-commit Hook**: Run verification rules before commit
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Enforce quality gates in build process
3. **IDE Integration**: Real-time violation highlighting
4. **Code Review**: Automated correction suggestions
5. **Documentation**: Rules serve as living documentation

## Conclusion

The `specs/verification` and `specs/correction` modules are not just quality tools but the **executable embodiment of stdLibSchema's architectural principles**. They bridge the gap between documentation and enforcement, ensuring that the codebase remains consistent, maintainable, and aligned with design goals while providing automated remediation capabilities that reduce developer burden and improve productivity.
